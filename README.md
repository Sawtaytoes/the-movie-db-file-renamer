# The Movie DB File Renamer

This package renames a folder of movies or shows using [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/).

## Installation

```sh
yarn install
yarn dlx @yarnpkg/sdks vscode
```

## Usage

```sh
yarn movies FOLDER_LOCATION
yarn shows FOLDER_LOCATION
```

- Choose `movies` or `shows` based on the type of media you're looking up.
- `FOLDER_LOCATION`: The absolute path of the directory with your media files. Make sure they're all either movies or shows, not a mix.

### EXAMPLE

yarn start 'G:\Demos'
```
